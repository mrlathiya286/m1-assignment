                Huskies may be hard to train due to their stubborn nature, but
                that doesn't mean they are unintelligent dogs. Quite the
                opposite: they're very intelligent and need mental stimulation.
                If left to their own devices, with no one to interact with, they
                will amuse themselves by destroying all the things.

                Cat, (Felis catus), domesticated member of the family Felidae,
                order Carnivora, and the smallest member of that family. Like
                all felids, domestic cats are characterized by supple low-slung
                bodies, finely molded heads, long tails that aid in balance, and
                specialized teeth and claws that adapt them admirably to a life
                of active hunting. Cats possess other features of their wild
                relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile and
                powerful, and finely coordinated in movement.
